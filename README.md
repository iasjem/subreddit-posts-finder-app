# Subreddit Posts Finder (Swift)

* This project is based on my first take for dealing with APIs and part of my journey in learning how to code in Swift. 
* First version of app I made for using the Reddit API: [Reddit App](https://github.com/iasjem/Reddit-App-Swift) 
* This experimental covers various topics including CollectionView, TableView, SearchDelegate, MVVM Pattern and Cocoa libraries like Moya and ObjectMapper.
* I do not own any of the assets saved in this project.
* This app only serves as self-study.
